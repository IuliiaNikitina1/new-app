    "time-management-proof": "I always create a list of tasks for a day and keep track of goals set for a week and a month.

    "creativity-proof": "I make and accomplish ideas of my projects completely alone. At the moment I have already created an application which helps to set an itinerary for a trip to my home city (Saint-Petersburg). I am also working on an application for keeping a personal diary of nutrition and sport activities. I love starting new projects and finding approaches to untrivial tasks.",
    "communication-proof-1": "During two years I was a member of a volunteering club 'Buddy System' at my university. I was a buddy for several students from European and Asian countries and easily got into contact with everyone. Apart from helping foreign students with accommodation and visas my goal was to help them settle in fast in Saint-Petersburg and feel at home there.",
    "communication-proof-2": "My communicative skills are also well illustrated by my two-year teaching experience. Over this time I've conducted more than 1000 English lessons and had 9 students at the peak, each of them had found me through recommendations of each other. I've been working with adults from 16 to 45 years with a different level of knowledge, different goals, from different professional spheres. However, I've developed warm and trust relationships with everyone and helped all of my students achieve their goals, from integration in international IT-companies to successful university enrolment.",
    "problem-solving-proof": "I like to look for solutions of difficult problems and do it pretty fast. It is especially evident when it comes to finding ways to implement a certain functionality or fix an error. While working on my bachelor thesis I had to learn some necessary technologies almost from scratch, including React library and API of one navigation service. I have accomplished all my goals successfuly, with the help of documentation and study courses.",
